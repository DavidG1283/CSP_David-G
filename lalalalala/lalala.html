    <h2>His Life</h2>
    <p>Born on February 5, 1985, he is still one of the best players in the world even though he is 40 years old. After you think about it for some time, he is and will be the best player in the world forever <small>(even better than Messi)</small>. You can never stop thinking of him; he is handsome, a millionaire, and a really good player. He is a kind soul who donates blood, hair, and money to kids with cancer or other diseases. He always wants the best for his fans, which is why he has created a lot of free games and campaigns against cancer.</p>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, the best player in the world, is the player with the biggest number of goals and assists. In his entire career, he has played for five different teams and has been the best player in all those clubs. No one is better than him; he is like "LeGoat" in football and he is my inspiration to live. My mother gave me life, but Cristiano makes me want to live. If Cristiano has a million fans, I'm one of them; if he has one fan, it's me; if he has no fans, that means Iâ€™ve died.</p>
    <p>I love you Cristiano.</p>
