<h2> His life</h2>




<p> Born in February 5, 1985, he is still one of the bets players in the world even tho he is 40 years old. After you think about it for some time, he is and will be the best playerin the world forever and ever <small> (even better than messi) </small>. You can never stop thinking of him, he is handsome, millionare, and a really good player. He is a really kind soul that donates blood, hair, and money to kids with cancer or other diseases, he always wants the best for his fans and that is why he has crated a lot of free games and campaigns against cancer.</p>
<h2>Career </h2>
<p> Cristiano Ronaldo, the best player in the world. He is the player with the bilgest amount of goals and assistances. In his entire career he has played for 5 different teams, and he have been the best playter in all those 5 clubs. No one is never better than him, he is like LeGoat in FUTBOL and he is my inspiration to live. My mother gave me life but Cristiano makes me want to live. If cristiano has A Million of fans I'm one of them, if he has one fan its me, if he has no fans that means that I've died.  </p>
<p> I love you cristiano</p>
